1.first install git

<<<<<<< HEAD
2.then initiate git in that folder containing some code file here (git commands.txt)

git init


3. add files that to be connected (containing code)

git add "<filename>"  here git add "git commands.txt"

4.to check status of git

git status

5. To try new code create new brach named test

git branch test

6.To switch to new branch for working on new code 

git checkout test

7.To create one brach named test1 and checkout to that in one command

git checkout -b test1

8. delete all code/text in file (or make some changes which are not stable) and to save/commit file to git

git add .

git commit -m "messed everything up"

(VIMP Note - It is must to add and commit before switching branch in order to save your code that has been written on particular branch)

9.if you open that file you will see nothing as you deleted everything on test1 branch'

10. Now switch to master branch by

git checkout master

11. now if you open file you can see original file with code. Thus we saved original code on master branch and did trial on test1 branch.

12. To check which branch your are on

git branch

>>>>>>> test1
